My name is Kidane Mengisteab, I also go by the name KD, and for the last few years, I have worked through a variety of jobs experience. These multiple of job ranged from working as global unarmed security for Facebook to my last former job, as a teller at US bank. As former teller at US bank, I work with multiple high end individuals to help access their personal accounts, help reach out to bankers, work against account fraud, etc... Moving forward, I have built the necessary work foundation, culture, ethic, and perspective needed to go forward to any job I settle in.
